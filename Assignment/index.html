          Solo travel for men and solo trips are what I’m all about…so if you’re
          looking for solo travel destinations, you’re in the right place!
        </p>
        <p id="line1">
          Ready to see the world? Do it on your own timeline! For the ultimate
          in indulgent travel, take a solo adventure. There are few things as
          liberating and exciting as traveling alone.
        </p>
        <p id="line2">
          For me, factors that make a city great for solo travel are: the ease
          of getting around by yourself (whether there is a good transportation
          system or it’s easily walkable), how safe a city is, whether the city
          is known for friendly locals (you never know when you’ll need a
          helping hand), and the number of sights to see!
        </p>
        <p id="line3">
          See exactly what you want to see, maximize every moment, and open
          yourself up to experiences that you would have never had traveling
          with friends or family.
        </p>
        <p id="line4">
          Feeling inspired? Get out there! I know traveling alone can be scary,
          but it is so worth it.
